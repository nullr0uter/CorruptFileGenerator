# A program that generates a corrupt file with an extension of your choice for when your paper is due but youÂ´re not finished, yet ;)
# Usage:
Just compile the .cpp file like this:
```
g++ -o CorruptedFileGenerator FileGenerator.cpp
```
The program will just create a buch of random bytes according to the wanted size you put into the program.
# Enjoy :)
